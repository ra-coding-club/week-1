## So how do you get on the web?

You get a web *site*! You purchase a domain from one of many domain providers, such as [Google Domains](https://domains.google/), [Go Daddy](https://www.godaddy.com/
) and [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/). There are also free options such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## HTML Syntax

* Power in tags `</>`
* `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the gender of the web page; it lets the browser know that it is dealing with HTML5
* `<html></html>` is the actual web page; it lets the browser know that the HTML code is within these tags
* `<head></head>` is the brain of the web page, where all of the metadata is stored, such as the page's `<title></title>`
* `<body></body>` is the literal body of the web page; everything in here is visible

### Sample HTML Web Page

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<title>This Text Will Show Up in a Browser Tab</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<h1>This text will show up on the page.</h1>
		</body> 
	</html>
