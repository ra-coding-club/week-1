# Lesson Plan

## Overview

The purpose of this first workshop is for students to...
* ...be introduced to the facilitator 
* ...setup necessary online components 
* ...learn internet basics 
* ...learn website fundamentals
* ...learn Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) syntax

## Standards

By the end of this week, students should be able to...
* ...recall essential internet and World Wide Web (WWW) milestones, including
    * Knowing who invented the WWW and when
    * The main languages that comprise the WWW
        * HTML
        * Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
        * ECMAscript—ES/JavaScript (JS)
    * Internet safety (HTTP vs. HTTPS)
* ...characterize the parts of a webpage skeleton
    * HTML is the bone
        * To be alive and functional, a website must have a spinal cord
    * CSS is the skin
        * An okay website is a caveman (not a lot of clothes), but
        * An exceptional website is a businessman (with fancy clothes)
    * JS is the muscle
    * The perfect website is physically fit and can perform actions quickly, in the blink of an eye
* ...develop a deep understanding of basic HTML, including...

    * ...the purpose of HTML in a webpage
    * ...the evolution of the language through HTML5
    * ...being able to identify critical HTML syntax (i.e. tags)

        * `<html></html>`
        * `<head></head>`
        * `<body></body>`
* ...setup and use a realistic cloud source code editor
* ...identify the differences between a source code editor and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* ...ultimately begin learning how to input/output (I/O) plain text to the web browser in the form of HTML

## Objectives

Students will be introduced to...
* ...GitHub and source code editor
* ...website fundamentals
    * Internet basics
    * Website basics
* ...HTML
After the lesson, students will...
* ...“cool down” on the material covered
* ...culminate with a coding playground (experiment with newly-acquired skills)

## Activity

Further reinforce the lessons by allotting time toward the end of the session (after the "cool down") for experimentation with
newly-learned skills through the use of free online code editors, such as [http://jsfiddle.net/](jsfiddle.net) or [https://codepen.io/](codepen.io).
