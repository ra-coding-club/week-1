## Objectives
Students will be introduced to...
* ...GitHub and source code editor
* ...website fundamentals
    * Internet basics
    * Website basics
* ...HTML
After the lesson, students will...
* ...“cool down” on the material covered
* ...culminate with a coding playground (experiment with newly-acquired skills)
## Activity
Further reinforce the lessons by allotting time toward the end of the session (after the "cool down") for experimentation with
newly-learned skills through the use of free online code editors, such as [http://jsfiddle.net/](jsfiddle.net) or [https://codepen.io/](codepen.io).# week-1
